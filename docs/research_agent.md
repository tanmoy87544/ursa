# ResearchAgent Documentation

`ResearchAgent` is a powerful tool for conducting internet-based research on any topic. It leverages language models and web search capabilities to gather, process, and summarize information from online sources.

## Basic Usage

```python
from ursa.agents import ResearchAgent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize with default model (gpt-4o-mini)
researcher = ResearchAgent()

# Or initialize with a custom model
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=10000)
researcher = ResearchAgent(llm=model)

# Run a research query
result = researcher.run("Who are the 2025 Detroit Tigers top 10 prospects and what year were they born?")

# Access the research results
final_summary = result["messages"][-1].content
sources = result["urls_visited"]

print("Research Summary:")
print(final_summary)
print("Sources:", sources)
```

## Parameters

### Initialization

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `llm` | str or BaseChatModel | "openai/gpt-4o-mini" | The language model to use for research |
| `**kwargs` | dict | {} | Additional parameters passed to the base agent |

### Run Method

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `prompt` | str | Required | The research question or topic |
| `recursion_limit` | int | 100 | Maximum recursion depth for the research process |

## Features

- **Automated Web Search**: Uses DuckDuckGo to find relevant information
- **Content Processing**: Extracts and summarizes content from web pages
- **Iterative Research**: Continues researching until sufficient information is gathered
- **Source Tracking**: Records all URLs visited during research
- **Internet Connectivity Check**: Verifies internet access before attempting research

## Output

The agent returns a dictionary containing:

- `messages`: A list of message objects, with the final message containing the comprehensive research summary
- `urls_visited`: A list of all sources consulted during the research process

## Advanced Usage

```python
from ursa.agents import ResearchAgent

# Initialize with custom parameters
researcher = ResearchAgent(
    llm="openai/gpt-4o",
    url="https://www.example.com"  # Custom URL for internet connectivity check
)

# Run with higher recursion limit for complex topics
result = researcher.run(
    "What are the latest developments in quantum computing? Summarize in markdown format.",
    recursion_limit=200
)
```

## Notes

- The agent requires internet connectivity to function properly
- Rate limiting is implemented to avoid overwhelming search services
- For networks with SSL inspection, you may need to set the `CERT_FILE` environment variable
- The research process includes multiple steps: search, content processing, review, and final summarization
